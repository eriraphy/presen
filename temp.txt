In our large community of developers and QA professionals, we constantly strive to enhance productivity across various tools. However, these tools often come with their own set of challenges, such as steep learning curves and reliability issues. As a developer and data scientist, I’ve shared the same hands-on experiences and faced similar challenges as our team. This motivated me to explore new tools, particularly those leveraging modern machine learning techniques.


We initiated a call to our community to try it out and provide hands-on feedback. Our goal was to share knowledge and experiences, uncover productivity hacks, streamline user onboarding, and ensure best practices and compliance.
We wanted to turn the learning curve into a fun ride and make sure everyone was on the same page.



Next, let's take a look at the practices and benefits of using Copilot, as summarized from our site, starting with the developers.

Firstly, and most obviously, Copilot can significantly boost productivity. When working with Copilot, we can effortlessly generate code and script snippets after defining functions, between brackets, inside conditions, or whenever we start a new line. This works exceptionally well when function names are clear, comments are detailed, or the surrounding context is reasonable. This basic code contribution improves efficiency, especially when dealing with repetitive tasks like unit tests, freeing us from cumbersome condition coverage and data mocking.

In addition, Copilot enhances code reliability. Trained on a vast scope of code from GitHub, it often suggests functions or implementations with low complexity in time and space. If we leave optimization hints in function names or comments, it provides optimized algorithms or approaches, improving code quality. Copilot adapts to our existing code and feedback, using consistent conventions and styles, which ensures better consistency and maintainability. This also results in fewer issues detected by tools like SonarQube or Checkmarx.

Furthermore, Copilot serves as an excellent mentor for new frameworks or unfamiliar technical stacks, offering opportunities to discover and learn new techniques independently. Often, it’s a better choice than searching Google or Stack Overflow, as GPT has been trained on content from these sites. While its suggestions might sometimes be incorrect, they still provide valuable ideas and expand our implementation options.

With the site built and colleagues contributing feedback and practices, we can provide tailored recommendations for developers at various levels of experience in development and machine learning.

For users without much experience with Copilot, the first step is to install and try it. You can review the practices summarized by early adopters on our website to gain a basic understanding of how and what Copilot can be used for in daily work. You might have concerns about its usage, the effort saved, or discomfort with the generated results. At this stage, we encourage you to seek help from more experienced users and provide feedback on our site. This will enrich the content we offer and make it easier for everyone to get hands-on with Copilot.

For users with experience in using Copilot or a background in its mechanism and prompt engineering, we encourage you to incorporate more Copilot usage into your daily work. You can practice and improve using the examples collected by our colleagues on the site. While you may still have concerns about suggestion accuracy and result adoption, we suggest exploring our site to find best practices and tips from others. This will help you discover how to interact with Copilot more efficiently.

For users familiar with how Copilot works, especially experts in NLP and LLM, your experience and knowledge would be incredibly valuable to our team and community. We encourage you to contribute your insights to our site, exploring more possibilities with this tool for our daily work and providing valuable suggestions. As a state-of-the-art LLM engineering product, Copilot still has many niche use cases that can greatly benefit developers. Your contributions will be a tremendous help to newcomers and the broader community.


With the rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) products, various industries are experiencing improvements in quality and productivity. GitHub Copilot is one such tool, specifically designed to assist programmers by offering intelligent code completion and suggestions.
In case you're not familiar with Copilot, it's an innovative tool developed by GitHub based on OpenAI's GPT-3. Using prompt engineering, it provides real-time, inline code suggestions to enhance your coding experience.
